# tortise
A library that makes working with working with turtles a little bit easier. Provides wrappers around directional functions such as placeUp that allow you to pass a string direction instead IE place("up"). Provides more complex movement functions that can traverse multiple blocks, move to a vector, mine blocks recursively, and execute a callback before each step.
